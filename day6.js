/*A string a=a1a2…an is called even if it consists of a concatenation (joining) of strings of length 2 consisting of the same characters. In other words, a string a is even if two conditions are satisfied at the same time:
its length n is even;
for all odd i (1≤i≤n−1), ai=ai+1 is satisfied.
For example, the following strings are even: "" (empty string), "tt", "aabb", "oooo", and "ttrrrroouuuuuuuukk". The following strings are not even: "aaa", "abab" and "abba".
Given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Find the minimum number of characters to remove from the string s to make it even. The deleted characters do not have to be consecutive.
Input
The first line of input data contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) —the number of test cases in the test.
The descriptions of the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of one string s (1≤|s|≤2⋅105), where |s| — the length of the string s. The string consists of lowercase Latin letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| on all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
Output
For each test case, print a single number — the minimum number of characters that must be removed to make s even.
